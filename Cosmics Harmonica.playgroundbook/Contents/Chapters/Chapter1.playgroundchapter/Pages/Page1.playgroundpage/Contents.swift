 ## Introduction
 Hi! I'm **Steven**, an undergraduate software engineering student in Monash University, Malaysia. I love two things: coding 👨🏻‍💻 and science 🚀. I will try to teach you one of my passions using the other.
 
 ### Inspiration
 
 *I always felt like I had to choose a career path: artist or engineer. But I came to realise that art and science do not exist on the opposite ends of the spectrum. And in this playground, we will visualise the marriage of science and art* 😊
 
## The sacred geometry of planetary orbits
 
 Planets in the universe move in a coordinated orbital patterns, but do you know they are dancing to the great music of the cosmos?
 
 The pattern on the right is the resulting geometrical pattern of the relative planetary position of Venus and Earth 🌍 in their orbits over an eight years period.
 
 As we explore the geometrical math and science behind it in this playground, we will understand how each planetary pairing has its own unique dance rhythm.

 [Let's get right into it!](@next)
